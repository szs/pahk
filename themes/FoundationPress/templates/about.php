      <ol class="text-block column large-6 medium-8 small-centered custom-counter">
        <li>Art should be accessible to everyone rather than being confined within the walls of museums, galleries and private collections;</li>
        <li>To breathe life to public space and bring people of the community together, creating communal spirit and identity;</li>
        <li>To reflect the value of the society and its conscience of cultural development;</li>
        <li>PAHK gives opportunities to Hong Kong artists to think and create in terms of large space which otherwise is not feasible within their own small and confined studio; </li>
        <li>To showcase to the world that Hong Kong is not only thriving economically but also throbbing with artistic pursuits. </li>
